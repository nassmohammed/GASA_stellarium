## Navajo Sky Culture Segment
- **Key point**: Different cultures map the same stars differently  
- **Constellations**: Revolving Male, Revolving Female  
- **Fun facts**:  

Náhookòs Bi’kà’ (Revolving Male)
The stars of the Big Dipper, called Náhookòs Bi’kà’, the Male Revolving One, can be culturally seen as a male warrior, a leader who protects his people. He is sympathetic and charismatic, as well as a provider for his family and home.

As a father, he provides spiritual and physical protection to his family.

The term Náhookòs refers to the double motion of the constellation as it revolves around the north star, while rotating at the same time. This constellation is always paired with a female counterpart, Náhookòs Bi’áád (Cassiopeia)

Náhookòs Bi’áád (Revolving Female)
In Navajo astronomy, the stars of Cassiopeia form the constellation Náhookòs Bi’áád, the Female Revolving One. This constellation is the female partner of Náhookòs Bi’kà’. She is a woman who exemplifies motherhood and regeneration. She provides growth, stability in the home and the strength necessary for harmony.
